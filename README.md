# Discontinued
The project will be reborn in .Net Core with an actual MVC framework maybe even with Blazor. And will leverage my other repository with algorithms in C# to implement the path finding. 

# GraphVisualizer
Static Web App that allows the user to draw obstacles in a graph and select a path finding algorithm, then visualize how that selected algorithm solves the problem i.e how it travels from the starting node to the end node

This is currently under development so feel free to reach out to help with some features

Current progress can be seen here: https://lorenzo-bulosan.github.io/GraphVisualizer/
